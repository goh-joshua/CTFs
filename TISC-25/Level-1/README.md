DESCRIPTION

NON STANDARD FLAG FORMAT!

FORMAT IS ALL LOWERCASE

YOU NEED TO FIND THE NAME OF THE LAKE

FLAG FORMAT: tisc{lake_?????????}

One of our U2 spy planes spotted Spectre units around the area surrounding these lakes. However we lost location metadata while collecting huge amounts of imagery. Can you help us find the name of the lake marked by the target reference point '+' symbol?

https://satellites.pro/ might be useful to compare a variety of imagery sources.
