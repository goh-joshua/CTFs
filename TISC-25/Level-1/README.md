# Level-1 - Target Reference Point üõ∞Ô∏è GEOINT
DESCRIPTION

NON STANDARD FLAG FORMAT!

FORMAT IS ALL LOWERCASE

YOU NEED TO FIND THE NAME OF THE LAKE

FLAG FORMAT: tisc{lake_?????????}

One of our U2 spy planes spotted Spectre units around the area surrounding these lakes. However we lost location metadata while collecting huge amounts of imagery. Can you help us find the name of the lake marked by the target reference point '+' symbol?

https://satellites.pro/ might be useful to compare a variety of imagery sources.

So we are given the image above.

<p> So you just right click and ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/73598fb9-8531-4540-a18b-3d08f2955f0f) .

And if the search alogrithm favours you, a [pdf](https://www.ykrasi.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Waterbird-Population-Dynamics-Kukila-2014-2-min-2.pdf) containing the image will be found. 

Using my mouse and scroll wheel, I found out that the lake in the picture was the Melintang Lake in Indonesia.

So with my keyboard, I generated the flag.

Flag: tisc{lake_melintang}
